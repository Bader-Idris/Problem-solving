/*
In programming, a palindrome is a word, phrase, number,
  or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.
  For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because if you read it backward,
  it's still "racecar". Similarly, the number 1001 is a palindrome
  because if you read it backward, it's still 1001.
  Palindromes are often used in programming exercises or as part of algorithms
  to test for certain conditions or to manipulate data in specific ways.

//? instead of returning boolean value, they want it to be 0 as false, 1 as true

function PalinArray(arr,n){
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // if (arr.length % 2 == 0) return false;
    // else {
      // Math.ceil(arr.length/2)
    // }
    // arr[i]
  }
}
console.log(PalinArray([1,2,1],n))
// needs maintenance
